R-code for Figure 3 in an article entitled:

"Faster Bank Runs"

By, Oz Shy

The R-code "runfast_2024_x_y.R" draws Figure 6 in the paper (simulations of optimal liquidity requirement). 

All algebraic derivations for the above article (not related to the R-code) can be found on "runfast_2024_x_y.pdf" (which the reader can download). The reader can then scroll down to the desired derivation using the same section, subsection, and equation numbers correspoding to the paper itself.

The above PDF file was constructed using a symbolic algebra software called "Derive for Windows." The file "runfast_2024_x_y.dfw" requires this sofware (which most people don't have). Therefore, it is sufficient for the reader to download only the PDF.
